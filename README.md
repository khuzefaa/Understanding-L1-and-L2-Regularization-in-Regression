# Understanding-L1-and-L2-Regularization-in-Regression
explores the impact of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques on linear regression models. By applying these techniques to a regression problem, the notebook demonstrates how they help reduce overfitting and manage model complexity by penalizing large weights.Visualization of the loss curves and coefficient shrinkage effects are included for a clear understanding of each method‚Äôs impact.
# L1 and L2 Regularization in Linear Regression

This notebook demonstrates how to implement and compare **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization techniques using `scikit-learn` and other common Python libraries. Regularization is a crucial concept in machine learning used to prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to the loss function.

## üß† Objective

- Understand the mathematical and practical differences between L1 and L2 regularization.
- Apply both techniques to a regression model.
- Visualize the impact of regularization strength on model coefficients and performance.
