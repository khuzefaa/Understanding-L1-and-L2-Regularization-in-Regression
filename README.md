# Understanding-L1-and-L2-Regularization-in-Regression
explores the impact of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques on linear regression models. By applying these techniques to a regression problem, the notebook demonstrates how they help reduce overfitting and manage model complexity by penalizing large weights.
